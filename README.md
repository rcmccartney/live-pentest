# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: __________________

Vulnerability #2: __________________


## Green

Vulnerability #1: Username Enumeration

We use the fact that real users have bold error messages,
while non-users are unbolded. We could script against this
to get more usernames.

Vulnerability #2: __________________


## Red

Vulnerability #1: IDOR

You can change the id field to access data that should not be accessible.
The other two sites redirect you to the territories.php site, most likely
by checking my access to the requested page and redirecting if I am not
authorized to view it.
